Predicting defaulting on credit card applications
A Taiwan-based credit card issuer wants to better predict the likelihood of default for its customers, as well as identify the key drivers that determine this likelihood.

When customers come in financial difficulties, there are indicators which can be used to anticipate the final outcome, such as late payments, a different browsing pattern on the web or mobile app. By using such patterns it is possible to prevent, or at least guide the process and provide a better service for the customer as well as reduced risks for the bank.

In this tutorial we will look at how to predict defaulting, using statistics, machine learning and deep learning. We we also look at how to summarize the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Explainability
Understanding why a given model predicts the way it predicts, it probably just as important as achieving a good accuracy on the predicted results. I will present 3 methods which can be used to interpret and explain the result and gain a better understanding on the dataset and the various.


Extract from the dataset: "This research aimed at the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients."
